Introducing Tags – a smarter way to manage your links on Dub.

With tags, you can now:

1. Organize your links by campaigns, clients, or any other categories you can think of.
2. [Filter your links by tags](https://twitter.com/dubdotsh/status/1661078957628719105) and get a shareable link to the filtered results.
3. Easily edit/delete your tags with a [Notion-style dropdown interface](https://twitter.com/dubdotsh/status/1661078955271569430).

This has been a [highly](https://github.com/steven-tey/dub/issues/101) [requested](https://github.com/steven-tey/dub/issues/124) feature since day one (shoutout to our friends at [Refine](https://refine.dev) as well), and we're excited to finally ship it!
